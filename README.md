# Bank-loan
 The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing various metrics related to loans and their repayment to assess the financial health of the bank's lending operations. The key performance indicators (KPIs) included in the project are:

Good Loans: These are loans that are performing well and are being repaid as per the agreed terms. This metric helps in understanding the proportion of loans that are in good standing.

Bad Loans: Bad loans represent loans that have become delinquent or defaulted. This metric is crucial for assessing credit risk and the potential for loan loss.

Defaulters: Defaulters are customers who have failed to meet their loan repayment obligations. Monitoring the number and proportion of defaulters can help the bank manage credit risk effectively.

Total Amount Funded: This KPI measures the total value of loans disbursed by the bank. It provides an overview of the bank's lending activity and the level of risk exposure.

Total Amount Received: This metric tracks the total amount of money the bank has received from loan repayments. It provides insight into the bank's cash inflow from lending operations.

Interest Rate: Interest rates play a key role in the bank's profitability and risk management. Analyzing the range and distribution of interest rates can help the bank optimize its lending strategy.

By using SQL queries to extract data from the bank's database, you ensure data accuracy and reliability. The extracted data is then imported into Power BI for analysis and visualization.

In Power BI, you can create interactive dashboards and visualizations to present these KPIs effectively. These visuals can include charts, tables, and gauges to provide insights into the performance of the bank's loan portfolio. Additionally, you can create filters and slicers to allow users to focus on specific aspects of the data, such as loan type, customer segments, or time periods.

Overall, this Power BI project provides a comprehensive view of the bank's lending operations and helps stakeholders make informed decisions to improve risk management and profitability.
